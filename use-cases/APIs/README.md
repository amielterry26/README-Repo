### These Are things to look into and potentially make directories for in API development.
1.	`FastAPI:`<br/>
	•	What it is: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.<br/>
	•	Usage: Useful for building fast, efficient, and robust APIs with Python.<br/>
	•	Fit: Fits well with your Python-based backend development.<br/>


2. `Express.js:`<br/>
	•	What it is: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.<br/>
	•	Usage: Useful for building APIs with Node.js.<br/>
	•	Fit: Fits well if you plan to use Node.js for server-side development.<br/>

#### These are the main things I will need for the backend for APIs:
- `Python:`<br/>
  •	Django: High-level, full-featured framework.<br/>
  •	Flask: Lightweight, flexible framework.<br/>
  •	FastAPI: High-performance, modern framework for APIs.<br/>
