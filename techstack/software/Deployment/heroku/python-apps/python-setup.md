Certainly! Let me clarify these points for you:

1. "Sleep" in Heroku context:
   - When a free tier app "sleeps", it becomes inactive and stops running.
   - If someone tries to access a sleeping app, there will be a delay (usually 10-30 seconds) as Heroku "wakes up" the app before serving the request.
   - After waking up, the app functions normally until it goes back to sleep after another period of inactivity.

2. Accessing a sleeping app:
   - Yes, people can still access the URL of a sleeping app.
   - They'll experience a delay on the first access as the app wakes up.
   - Subsequent requests will be faster until the app sleeps again.

3. Differences between Free and Paid Dynos:
   Free Dyno:
   - Sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - 550 free dyno hours per month
   - Less powerful (512 MB RAM, shared CPU)
   - No custom domains with SSL
   
   Paid Dynos (e.g., Hobby, Standard):
   - Never sleep
   - More powerful (starting from 512 MB RAM, dedicated CPU)
   - Custom domains with SSL
   - Ability to scale horizontally (run multiple dynos)
   - Better metrics and logging
   - Automatic healing

4. Heroku Dashboard:
   - The Heroku Dashboard is web-based, not desktop-only.
   - You can access it from any device with a web browser at https://dashboard.heroku.com/
   - There's also a Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface) for managing apps from your terminal.

5. Database options:
   - Heroku Postgres is the default, fully managed database option.
   - However, Heroku supports other databases through add-ons:
     - JawsDB MySQL and ClearDB MySQL for MySQL databases
     - MongoDB Atlas for MongoDB
     - Redis Cloud for Redis
   - You can use JawsDB MySQL or ClearDB MySQL add-ons for MySQL support.

To use MySQL with Heroku:
1. Choose a MySQL add-on (JawsDB or ClearDB) from the Heroku Elements marketplace.
2. Add it to your app using the Heroku dashboard or CLI.
3. Update your application's database configuration to use the provided MySQL connection details.

Remember, while Heroku makes it easy to deploy and scale apps, it's designed around a PostgreSQL-centric ecosystem. If MySQL is crucial for your app, you might want to consider other hosting options that provide native MySQL support, or be prepared to use Heroku's MySQL add-ons.
