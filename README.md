# Welcome to the Master READMEs Repo. 
This repository contains documentation, guides, and cheatsheets for various technologies and tools in my techstack.
It is also the home and starting point for my __*"Syntax"*__ Project.
________________________
> Purpose:
To initially serve as my personal learning center, but I hope to eventually turn it into something useful for others to use and be able to learn from. 

### Included you will see directories such as:
- `Localmachine` - A library for everything I need to set-up and run my local machine on MacOS. (I may move this to it's own repo later).
<br/> 
- `Overview` - A full list of all of my techologies, languages, and use-cases.
<br/>
- `TechStack` - Which will be a full broken down list of my TechStack so far (including the languages, software, use cases, and more).

### Some of the things I would Like to accomplish:
1. Provide a full syntax cheatsheet for each of the languages and frameworks I am learning.
2. Develop an easy, digestible way for people who are conceptual thinkers & learners to tackle the difficult and convoluted concept of coding and programming.
